//! Onion Messages: sending, receiving, forwarding, and ancillary utilities live here
//!
//! Onion messages are multi-purpose messages sent between peers over the lightning network. In the
//! near future, they will be used to communicate invoices for [offers], unlocking use cases such as
//! static invoices, refunds and proof of payer. Further, you will be able to accept payments
//! without revealing your node id through the use of [blinded paths].
//!
//! LDK sends and receives onion messages via the [`OnionMessenger`]. See its documentation for more
//! information on its usage.
//!
//! [offers]: <https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/798>
//! [blinded paths]: crate::blinded_path::message::BlindedMessagePath
//! [`OnionMessenger`]: self::messenger::OnionMessenger
