/// `BackgroundProcessor` takes care of tasks that (1) need to happen periodically to keep
/// Rust-Lightning running properly, and (2) either can or should be run in the background. Its
/// responsibilities are:
/// * Processing [`Event`]s with a user-provided [`EventHandler`].
/// * Monitoring whether the [`ChannelManager`] needs to be re-persisted to disk, and if so,
///   writing it to disk/backups by invoking the callback given to it at startup.
///   [`ChannelManager`] persistence should be done in the background.
/// * Calling [`ChannelManager::timer_tick_occurred`] and [`PeerManager::timer_tick_occurred`]
///   at the appropriate intervals.
///
/// It will also call [`PeerManager::process_events`] periodically though this shouldn't be relied
/// upon as doing so may result in high latency.
///
/// # Note
///
/// If [`ChannelManager`] persistence fails and the persisted manager becomes out-of-date, then
/// there is a risk of channels force-closing on startup when the manager realizes it's outdated.
/// However, as long as [`ChannelMonitor`] backups are sound, no funds besides those used for
/// unilateral chain closure fees are at risk.
